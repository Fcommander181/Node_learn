Big data refers to data that is so large, fast, or complex that it's difficult or impossible to process using traditional methods. The concept of big data gained momentum in the early 2000s when industry analyst Doug Laney articulated the now-mainstream definition of big data as the three V's. The amount of data that is available to organizations on products, customers, competitors, business operations, etc., is increasing exponentially.0 This data comes from many sources such as sensors, the internet of things, and websites to name a few.1 A big data environment doesn't have to contain a large amount of data, but most do because of the nature of the data being collected and stored in them.2Big data refers to data that is so large, fast, or complex that it's difficult or impossible to process using traditional methods.
